### Riffy Proposal
-----
## Do you ever wonder if your bank is saying, "What the L... is going on?"
## If so, I have a good idea!
    
# Basic Money Tracking - Calculator App

>This calculator will not include an interest and fees tool because your money will    be managed by you; not the bank.
>This will be an application to keep track of the balance inside your shoebox/tin, piggy-bank, or where-ever else.  
>Input any amount for the beginning balance.  
>Thereafter, input the amount you spend or save.   
>The value for deposit will be indicated by green fonts with a plus(+) sign.  
>The value for withdrawal will be indicated by red fonts with a minus(-) sign.

# My Target Audience

Young Savers
Old School Savers
Cold Hard Cash Carriers

# Stretch Goal

>To make it user friendly.
>To make it interactive.
>To make it a learning experience - the saver can drag the specific number of
  coins and bills into a virtual shoebox/tin, piggy-bank, or what-ever. 
>To make it rewarding - the saver can earn special badges.
